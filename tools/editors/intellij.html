<h1>IntelliJ</h1>

<strong>Why it is cool</strong>
<p>
    Free for students! Apply for a student license at <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students">IntelliJ's Website</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Supports many more languages!<br/>
    So once you are down with Web Programming, you can keep using the same editor. If you get into Android programming, the Android editor <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android Studio</a> is actually built on top of IntelliJ.
