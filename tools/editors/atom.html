<h1>Atom</h1>

<strong>Why it is cool</strong>

<p>
    Atom is an open source text editor that is built on the very technologies that you will be learning in Web
    Programming!.</p>

<p>So once you feel confident with HTML, JS and CSS you can then turn your hacking skills on your own text editor and
    add in
    what ever feature you can think up.
