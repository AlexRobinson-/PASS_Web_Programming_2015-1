<h1>Version Control</h1>

<p>Version control is incredibly important and no matter what language you code in, you will most likely need some form of version control.</p>
<p>To keep it simple, I recommend git although there are some other types of version control out there as well (svn).</p>

<p>It is important to note, that git is the name of the version control system. Where you store all of the files however, is completely up to you.</p>
<p>It is recommended however, that you keep your files stored on an online git repository host - think of this as just a storage space for your code.</p>

<br/>
<p>Two of the bigger repository hosts are</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="github.html">GitHub</a> - Most popular, but comes with only 5 free private repos</li>
    <li><a href="bitbucket.html">Bitbucket</a> - Not as popular - but comes with unlimited private repos!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Like something that isn't on here?</h2>
<p>Add it to the list!</p>
