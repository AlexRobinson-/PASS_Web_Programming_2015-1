<h1>Bitbucket</h1>

<p>Bitbucket is great because it comes with unlimited repositories (max 5 people working on the one repo).</p>

<p>I recommend using Bitbucket for your own personal projects - but chances are you will also need to have a <a
        href="github.html">GitHub</a> account as well (seeing as this code is hosted on GitHub).</p>

<p>Register an account on the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket website</a></p>
