<h1>Welcome to Week 2</h1>

<h2>Weekly Challenge</h2>

<p>

<p>
    Farmer Bob has created a small web page to advertise his eggs online. As his business mainly caters to older
    clients, who have very old browsers. Farmer Bob needs his website to be 100% XHTML compliant.
</p>

<p>
    It has been one week since Farmer Bob's website has gone live, but he is yet to sell any eggs. It turns out his
    website
    is not XHTML compliant and therefore not being rendered correctly on his customer's computers.
</p>

<p>
    Can you please correct Farmer Bob's website? Making it 100% XHTML Compliant?
